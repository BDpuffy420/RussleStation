		Changed the species restriction to a slowdown code instead.

Important note: When making shoes, use "baseslowdown" instead of
"slowdown". The latter is handled differently now. (It'll check if
you're digitigrade, then set that for the speed handling process. If you
aren't, it'll use the baseslowdown for this. But if you are, and they
aren't made for you, it'll use a very high slowdown)
