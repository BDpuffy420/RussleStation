<b><u>Some Basic Things:</u></b>
   - We dislike griefing. For us, and the other players, please don't do it.
   - Don't abuse Adminhelp, as said, we are here to help you, so please don't annoy us with unnecessary messages.
   - We admins try to be as nice as possible, sometimes we slip up, but cut us some slack, because hey, it's a lot of work doing what we do.
   - Don't be a Shitler...all the time
   - Don't ERP hunt every round, but if you do please take a useless job like assistant to do  that, because keep in  mind in real life if two doctors were fucking in the break room while people are dying do you really think they would be hired still?
   - READ THE FUCKING LORE YOU SHITLER IF YOU ARE GOING TO PLAY A XENO RACE http://wiki.baystation12.net/index.php/Fluff  We don't need special snowflakes running around because you will get banned for that shit!
